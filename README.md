Hydra Chat

This repository will eventually be a clone of the source code for [chat.gab.com](https://chat.gab.com). That source code is not yet released, so it's now only a stub.

For now, it's a place to collect issues for the Hydra-Developer team.

## Google Docs

Curtis Rock ([@crockwave@gab.com](https://gab.com/crockwave)) has created a pair of Google Docs for collecting Gab Chat issues and wishes. If you prefer that format to entering issues here, you can go to one of:
